# keyvault-rbac-tf-test

Testing Service Principal access to create key in Key Vault.
Creating service principal and assigning it to Key Vault access policy has been configured manually.

Need to replace `providers.tf`'s `azurerm` with user values:

```hcl
provider "azurerm" {
    alias = "keyvault-sp"
    features {}
    skip_provider_registration = true
    use_msi = false
    client_id = "client id of service principle"
    client_secret = "client secret generated by service principle"
    subscription_id = "subscription id"
    tenant_id = "tenant id"
}
```

Need to replace `providers.tf`'s `subscription-id`.
